ARC Prize 2024 Challenge: Vision Model with Reasoning Ability and Intuitive Decision-Making
This repository contains code for developing a model to solve the ARC (Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus) tasks as part of the ARC Prize 2024 competition. The goal is to build a "Vision model with reasoning ability" and an "Intuitive decision-maker" to solve novel tasks using JSON inputs and a 2D graphical interface.

Project Overview
The ARC Prize 2024 challenge requires developing an AI model that can:

Understand and interpret visual inputs (grids of colors).
Recognize patterns and transformations from a minimal set of examples.
Generate correct outputs for novel, unseen tasks.
Make intuitive decisions using an ensemble of possible solutions.
The model combines deep learning (for visual understanding) and rule-based reasoning (for pattern recognition and decision-making).

Installation
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/arc-prize-2024.git
cd arc-prize-2024
2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
3. Install Required Dependencies
Install all necessary Python libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
If requirements.txt is not provided, here are some basic libraries to install:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scipy json5
Additional libraries might be needed depending on the specific implementations (e.g., torch or tensorflow for deep learning models).

Usage
1. Prepare the Dataset
Ensure you have the following JSON files from the ARC dataset in the data directory:

arc-agi_training-challenges.json
arc-agi_training-solutions.json
arc-agi_evaluation-challenges.json
arc-agi_evaluation-solutions.json
arc-agi_test-challenges.json
sample_submission.json
You can download these files from the competition page on Kaggle or ARCPrize.org and place them in the data folder.

2. Run the Main Code
To execute the main script and start processing the tasks:

bash
Copy code
python arc-mastery.py
3. View Results and Visualizations
The script includes functions to visualize input grids, output predictions, and various intermediate steps. These visualizations will be displayed using matplotlib during the script's execution.

4. Modify or Add New Solvers
To implement additional solvers or modify existing ones, edit the arc-mastery.py file and define new functions under the solvers section.

5. Run Specific Examples
You can run specific task examples by modifying the arc-mastery.py file:

Use the hellow_arc() function to visualize a specific task.
Use the get_arc() function to retrieve task data for testing custom solvers.

Functions and Modules
Main Functions
load_data(file_path): Loads JSON data from a given file path.
visualize_grid(grid): Visualizes a 2D grid using matplotlib.
extract_features(grid): Extracts features from a grid using a CNN model.
generate_solutions(grid, features): Generates candidate solutions using various transformations.
score_solutions(candidates): Scores each candidate solution based on a heuristic or learned model.
select_best_solution(ranked_candidates): Selects the best solution from the ranked candidates.
process_tasks(tasks): Main loop to process all tasks and visualize results.
Solver Functions
f0000(inp, task): Applies rotations and flips to generate variations of the input grid.
f0001(inp, task): Sorts and draws repetitions of each color.
f0002(inp, task): Concatenates rotated versions to generate complex patterns.
f0003(inp, task): Selects specific zones from the input grid to generate outputs.
Examples
To run specific examples provided in the script:

Example 1: Visualize and solve a task from the training set.
python
Copy code
hellow_arc(185, 'train', True)
Example 4: Generate rotated and flipped versions of an input grid.
python
Copy code
inp = [[0, 1], [2, 3], [4, 5], [6, 7], [8, 9]]
clist = f0000(inp, [])
for x in clist:
    plot_pic(x)
Future Improvements
Integrate Deep Learning Models: Replace some heuristic solvers with deep learning models (e.g., Transformers or Graph Neural Networks) for more generalized pattern recognition.
Implement Feedback Loops: Develop feedback mechanisms for continuous learning from mistakes.
Enhance Visualization: Improve the 2D visualization interface with interactivity for better exploration of solutions.
