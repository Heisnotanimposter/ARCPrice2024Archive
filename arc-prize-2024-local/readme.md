Proposed File Structure
Given the seven sections in your code, we can create the following modular structure:

setup.py: This module will contain the initial setup, including imports and any configuration settings.

helpers.py: This file will include all helper functions like json_to_image, plot_pic, and plot_task. These utility functions are used across different parts of the project.

dataset.py: This will define the ARCDataset class and any associated dataset-related functions.

model.py: This module will contain the Vision Transformer model (VisionTransformer class) and any other model-related functions or utilities.

training.py: This will define the training loop (train_vit function) and handle the training logic, including setting up the optimizer, loss function, and dataloader.

submission.py: This file will handle the generation of the submission file based on the model predictions.

main.py: This will be the entry point for the project, where all modules are imported, and the overall execution flow is managed. It will call functions from the other modules to set up data, train the model, and generate the submission.
